Bitmark vs ERC 721

* Bitmark Issue
```
max issues per hour
= num of blocks generated in one hour * maximum num of issues per block
= (60 min / 3 min) * (10000 txs per block ÷ 2 txs/issue)
= 100,000
```

* Ethereum Issue
```
maximum num of issues per block
= (gas limit / gas used by transaction) * maximum number of issues in a tx
= (8000000 / 7816529) * 37
~ 37

num of issues per hour
= num of blocks generated in one hour * maximum num of issues per block
= (3600 sec / 15 sec) * 37
= 8,880
```

* Bitmark Transfer
```
max pending transfers per hour
= num of blocks generated in one hour * maximum num of transfers per block
= (60 min / 3 min) * 10000
= 200,000
 max confirmed transfers per hour
= min(max pending transfers per hour, throughput on BTC and LTC)
= min(200,000, (25,200 + 96,000))
= 121,200
```

* Ethereum Transfer
```
maximum num of tranfers per block
= gas limit / gas used by transaction
= 8000000 / 150000
~ 53 
num of transfers per hour
= num of blocks generated in one hour * maximum num of transfers per block
= (3600 sec / 15 sec) * 53
= 12,720
