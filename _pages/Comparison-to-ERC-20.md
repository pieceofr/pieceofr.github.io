* Bitmark Issue Throughput

```
1 share requires 2 blocks to complete, first block for asset & issue record, second block for share record

max shares per hour
= num of blocks generated in one hour * maximum num of issues per block
= (60 min / 3 min) * (10000 txs per block * 1/3 shares per block)
= 66,666
```

* Ethereum Issue Throughput

```
"The average blocktime is about 15s.
The current gas limit is about 8M.
 Contract use 1.6M.

maximum # of contract per block
= 8M / 1.6M
= 5

maximum contract per block
= (3600 / 15) * 5
= 1200
```

* Bitmark Transfer (Grant & Swap) Throughput

```
grant needs a transfer and counter-sign, to it takes 2 transactions for transfering tokens

max pending transfers per hour
= num of blocks generated in one hour * maximum num of transfers per block
= (60 min / 3 min) * (10000 tx * 1/2)
= 100,000
 max confirmed transfers per hour
= min(max pending transfers per hour, throughput on BTC and LTC)
= min(100,000, (25,200 + 96,000))
= 100,000
```

* Ethereum Transfer Throughput

```
"The average blocktime is about 15s.
The current gas limit is about 8M.
Non-exist account transfer costs 52k, existing account transfer costs 37k, on average takes 45k gas.

maximum # of transfer per block
= 8M / 45k
= 177

maximum transfer per block
= (3600 / 15) * 177
= 42480
```

* Ethereum Swap Throughput

```
Approval uses 40k gas, transferFrom uses 55k gas

2 approval and 2 transferFrom are used:
(40k + 55k) * 2 = 195k gas

maximum # of swap per block
= 8M / 195k
= 41

maximum transfer per block
= (3600 / 15) * 41
= 9840
